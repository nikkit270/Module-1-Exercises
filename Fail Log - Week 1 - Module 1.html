<p>For the first Module exercise, I found an annotation by a colleague that sparked my interest and I read the article a couple times in order to develop an argument for the comment that Vanessa had made. Her comment had also reminded me of information I had collected from resources outside of the course, helping me develop a better understanding of what sort of argument and reflection I wanted to write on this specific annotation that was by far the most interesting to me.</p>
<p>I wrote my entire first module reflection question regarding the most intersting annotation on Dillinger, then I had trouble connecting Dillinger and Github. I wanted to connect my files to Github from Dillinger, and I was not sure how I could achieve this. So, I did the best thing that a student in this course can do- turn to others for aid. I went on Slack and asked how I could connect Dillinger and Github. This is the comment I posted: “Hi all, was wondering how I could connect Dillinger and Github. I want to upload my files into Github but everytime I try it gives me a message stating, “Your document must be an imported file from Github”. I already completed my work on Dillinger but attempted to link Github, and for some reason the message keeps popping up. Anyone care to share advice (sorry, I’m so behind)”</p>
<p>Whenever I would click on Github on Dillinger, there would be a link symbol prompting me to click on it, however a message popped up stating (as mentioned in the comment I posted on Slack): “Your document must be an imported file from Github”. A student named Maggie Sherwin, commented back that she had the same issue. Professor Graham however helped me in the end, telling me that I had to save a copy of my work to my computer and upload it on Github. After creating a new file on Github, I uploaded “Exercise 1, Module 1 - Most Interesting Annotation.pdf” and connected the file. The file uploaded itself to Dillinger and I successfully connected Github and Dillnger together. This was my first experience in learning how to use both websites and connect them together.</p>
